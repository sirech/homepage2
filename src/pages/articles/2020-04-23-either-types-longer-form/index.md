I have [a lot to say about Either types using Kotlin](https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/either-data-type-alternative-throwing-exceptions). It just got published in our company blog. I had written about this [here](../kotlin-either-types-instead-of-exceptions/) before. This is a slightly longer version with nicer graphics. Check it out if you hadn't before!
