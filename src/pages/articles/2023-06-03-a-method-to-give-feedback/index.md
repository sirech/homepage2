Feedback, when used thoughtfully, is a superpower. It accelerates personal growth faster than anything you can achieve through introspection alone.

Over time, I've witnessed developers hinder their own careers, sometimes for years, by repeatedly making the same fundamental mistake. Imagine being able to influence and change that trajectory by simply proactively sharing feedback. That screams _senior engineer_ to me. Besides, when compared to the intricate technical problems you solve daily, offering feedback seems comparatively easier, doesn't it?

Why is it, then, that so many people wait until the last day before the performance review submission deadline to finally write down some feedback that's way too superficial to be useful? I don't know, man. Maybe it's for lack of a method? In this article, I'm going to share my approach to delivering feedback.

## What Constitutes Good Feedback?

There are two aspects of giving feedback:

- *The content:* The observation you're attempting to share
- *The delivery:* How you communicate the feedback to the intended recipient

Let's begin with the content. Don't wait for deep, career-changing insights before sharing feedback. Those come around rarely, if ever. Smaller things are a better candidates. Here are some situations that are good opportunities for feedback:

- How did she facilitate a meeting
- How did she answer to questions or criticisms while presenting an idea
- How did she structure a document to make a proposal

Make sure to refer to **concrete** events. Be as concrete as possible so that the other person knows what your talking about. For the same reason, talk about **recent** events. Memory gets hazy over time. It's significantly easier to discuss something when it's fresh on your mind. At the same time, it's probably good to avoid giving feedback _immediately_ after the fact. Waiting a bit helps cooling down.

Next, your input should be **actionable**. What's there to do differently next time? A situation with no realistic alternative is a dead end. Feedback is about finding ways to improve yourself, not grading your performance.

Lastly, it should be **constructive**. _You suck_ isn't feedback, even if you phrase it nicely. If you can't find a way to frame it so that it helps the person grow, refrain from giving any feedback in the first place.

In summary, keep the following in mind when thinking about the content:

- It should be **recent**
- It should be **concrete**
- It should be **actionable**
- It should be **constructive**

## Situation-Behavior-Impact

Assuming you have a good piece of feedback to share, the next step is figuring out the _delivery_. Giving feedback can be difficult, especially if it's not positive. That's why I like to stick to a structured pattern. It's commonly referred as **Situation-Behavior-Impact**. You break down your feedback in three distinct phases:

*Situation* describes the context, so that the receiver knows what you're talking about. This ties back to using a concrete example. Moreover, it being a recent situation means both of you are more likely to remember the details, avoiding misunderstandings. Your goal should be to set up the stage, not to bore the other person. After all, they were there as well. Make it as short as you can.

*Behavior* is about describing the actions you observed. **Key** word being observed. Acting as if you know exactly what somebody else was thinking is condescending and counterproductive. You'll probably be wrong, and the feedback won't land very well.

Instead of reading minds, focus on your observations. Make it clear that this is your perspective, which might be incomplete or even incorrect. Use a neutral tone and avoid making judgements. Your goal is to talk about actions.

*Impact* is the last part of the puzzle. What did the previous behavior _cause_, on you or somebody else? Talking about impact can be uncomfortable, but it's a necessary part of a complete piece of feedback. Based on this impact, the receiver can reflect and decide to do things differently the next time.

Impact can be subjective, so focus on what you saw, same as in the behavior part. At the same time, if the situation didn't have any observabe impact, is the feedback even worth sharing?

Using a fixed structure can feel forced, but it ensures consistency. When you're raising a thorny issue, this formula helps you concentrate on being as objective as possible. It's similar to the [STAR method](../the-behavioral-interview/) that's common in behavioral interviews, if you think about it.

## Practice!

Sharing imperfect feedback is preferable to sharing nothing, as long as you remain respectful and constructive. Remember that any formula isn't a substitute for practice. The only way to get better is to do it regularly. Don't leave it for the last possible moment. Take notes and share feedback regularly as soon as you have something meaningful, and it'll progressively get easier over time. 

I prefer giving feedback in person. I've always thought that what you write for an official review shouldn't come as a surprise to the receiver. However, if you feel more comfortable over chat or email, use that medium. Remove the barriers that are preventing you from doing it more often.

Another option is to go to the person's manager directly and share the feedback with them. Honestly, that sounds very foreign to me, so I have a hard time picturing myself doing it. I believe that building trust with others to a point where you can freely share and receive feedback is a better long-term investment for yourself. But, hey, I guess that _some_ feedback is better than just eschewing the practice altogether.

## Beware of Rigid Formulas

Even though I believe that a structured method like **SBI** can help, you should be ready to abandon any method and be adaptable instead. Feedback is a very personal thing. People have different preferences regarding format, medium, or anything else, really. Adapting your delivery to accomodate these preferences will improve your feedback's effectiveness. Especially so for people with whom you collaborate more closely, where there are more opportunities to exchange feedback.

For instance, some resources recommend using the _feedback sandwich_, where you wrap a negative piece of feedback in between two good ones. I despise this method, and find it fake and artificial. For that reason I might not pay attention to feedback that comes in that format. Everybody has their own anti-patterns, so it's a good idea to figure out those.

Using a formula allows you to be consistent. However, it's more important to be _genuine_.

## It's not Up to You Anymore

Alright, so your carefully crafted feedback is ready, and you go out and share it with the intended recipient. What's next?

Not much, really. In my opinion, you did your job already. Now, it's up to that person to digest it, reflect upon it, and decide how to act on it. It might well be that they choose to discard it. That's not necessarily bad! Remember that you only have a limited view of how somebody else acts and behaves.
