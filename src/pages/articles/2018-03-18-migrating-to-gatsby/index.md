Some months ago, I decided to rewrite my website using [React](https://reactjs.org/), to experiment with a bunch of new features of _React_ that I wanted to use at work. To spare myself the trouble of bootstrapping the whole thing, I used the awesome [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) from _Facebook_.

Lately I have been wanting to write a bit about things that I am doing. I wanted a super simple way to publish _Markdown_ files that I could host myself. After looking a bit around, it seemed that _CRA_ was not going to provide that unless I built a significant part of it myself.

Then I stumbled across [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/).
