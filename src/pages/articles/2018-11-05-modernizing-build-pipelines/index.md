I have been writing an article about modernizing build pipelines and it finally got published in our [Insights Blog](https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights): https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/modernizing-your-build-pipelines

It ended up being pretty long, but it condenses a couple of months of work. I hope it is useful for anybody who actually reaches the end of it!
