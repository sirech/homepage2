            I develop software for a living. Then I go home and continue reading about software because I just can't get enough. At some point, somebody thought it was a good idea to make me the technical lead of an agile team. I quickly discovered that building things myself is not the same as helping somebody else figure it out. I learned, somewhat to my surprise, that I really enjoy sharing ideas. According to their feedback, other developers have managed to learn something from me. At least they don't tend to run away screaming, which is, I think, a good thing.

            I have been working as a professional developer for more than ten years. If

            I specialize in web programming. I started doing backend work, then I got more and more into frontend topics, and lately I have managed to touch infrastructure as well. I don't know if there is such a thing as a 
            <b>
              Full Stack Developer
            </b>
            , but I definitely try to involve myself in all areas of software delivery.

            I have managed to work with plenty of

              tools

            . It took me a while to realize, though, that while reliable tech and good foundations are important, they are not the only thing needed to deliver high-quality software.
