Rather, it’s about how to organize teams.</p>\n<p>It’s almost impossible to work in the software industry and not hear regularly about <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Conway’s law (It’s not actually a law)</a>. It turns out that the way an organization is set up will influence the software architecture that it produces. Everybody is mindlessly using <a href=\"https://microservices.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">microservices</a> regardless of fit. But if I’m allowed to quote myself:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>All the fancy technology in the world won’t fix an organizational problem.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That’s pretty much the point of this book. Fast flow is easier to achieve if the teams are set up in a way that favors autonomy, and easy communication. Architecture will follow organization (See <a href=\"https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/inverse-conway-maneuver\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the inverse Conway maneuver</a>).</p>\n<h2>The core premise</h2>\n<p>This book essentially boils down to four team templates to use throughout an entire organization:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Stream-aligned team</li>\n<li>Enabling team</li>\n<li>Platform team</li>\n<li>Complicated subsystem team</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Stream-aligned</em> teams are what others call product teams. Teams aligned along the lines of a product, a stream, or a feature. They should be able to work independently for the most part without handing their artifacts over to another team. It requires a proper cross-functional setup.</p>\n<p>Certain services are too complex to handle for a team of generalists. That’s where <em>complicated subsystem</em> teams come in. Those can take ownership over these systems while they are (hopefully) refactored or replaced.</p>\n<p>Stream teams rely on infrastructure that is handled by <em>Platform</em> teams. A platform team treats other teams as customers and offers them a product they can consume to make their life easier. I want to get into this in more depth, as I’ve spent the last year working in such a team and have seen many challenges arise.</p>\n<p>Lastly, <em>enabling</em> teams help upskilling other teams that don’t have the time to dig into certain areas themselves. It can be focused on a concrete technology, or agile practices, or any skill that is required by those teams.</p>\n<h2>Models of communication</h2>\n<p>The last part of the book is dedicated to the communication patterns between the different types of teams. There are three: collaboration, X-as-a-service, and facilitation. I really like the idea of creating a vocabulary to talk about the different ways that teams use to interact with each other.</p>\n<h2>Verdict</h2>\n<p>In my view, the value of this book becomes clearer if you have seen how difficult it can get when the boundaries between teams are messed up. There are many examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>An operations team working in a ticket based model, blocking everybody else. Just renaming them to DevOps doesn’t fix anything, by the way.</li>\n<li>A strong separation between backend, frontend, and QA teams means that any simple feature goes through multiple teams to reach a customer.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As as I said in the beginning, no amount of microservices is going to fix that. And I like this book for providing a clear and explicit set of recommendations, and a language to talk about it. It gets ⭐⭐⭐⭐ stars.</p>","frontmatter":{"layout":"post","title":"Book Review: Team topologies","path":"/book-review-team-topologies/","categories":["Book Review","Practices","Team Organization"],"date":"2021/02/08","draft":false,"description":"Team topologies is a book that proposes four ways of organizing teams that aim to empower them to build better software","canonical":null,"image":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/5a4e6afeb4d6590001443a4557fae5af/38172/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/static/5a4e6afeb4d6590001443a4557fae5af/5589b/cover.jpg 86w,\n/static/5a4e6afeb4d6590001443a4557fae5af/15454/cover.jpg 171w,\n/static/5a4e6afeb4d6590001443a4557fae5af/38172/cover.jpg 342w","sizes":"(min-width: 342px) 342px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/5a4e6afeb4d6590001443a4557fae5af/e2828/cover.webp 86w,\n/static/5a4e6afeb4d6590001443a4557fae5af/1a23b/cover.webp 171w,\n/static/5a4e6afeb4d6590001443a4557fae5af/a0bf3/cover.webp 342w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 342px) 342px, 100vw"}]},"width":750,"height":1122.8070175438597}}}}},"related":{"nodes":[{"frontmatter":{"title":"Dev huddle as a tool to achieve alignment among developers","path":"/dev-huddle-as-a-tool-to-achieve-alignment-among-developers/","date":"2020/08/30"}},{"frontmatter":{"title":"Book Review: No rules rules, Netflix and the culture of reinvention","path":"/book-review-no-rules-rules-netflix/","date":"2020/12/13"}},{"frontmatter":{"title":"Book Review: Accelerate","path":"/book-review-accelerate/","date":"2021/03/07"}}]},"previous":{"frontmatter":{"title":"So, what does the NGINX ingress controller actually do?","path":"/what-does-the-nginx-ingress-controller-actually-do/","date":"2021/01/30"}},"next":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Authorization Code Flow with PKCE (OAuth) in a React application","path":"/oauth-authorization-code-flow-pkce-for-react/","date":"2021/03/29"}}},"pageContext":{"related":["/book-review-accelerate/","/book-review-no-rules-rules-netflix/","/dev-huddle-as-a-tool-to-achieve-alignment-among-developers/"],"previous":"/what-does-the-nginx-ingress-controller-actually-do/","next":"/oauth-authorization-code-flow-pkce-for-react/"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
