After all, they built things like <a href=\"https://research.google/pubs/pub27898/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bigtable</a>, <a href=\"https://research.google/pubs/pub39966/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Spanner</a>, and many others.</p>\n<p>However, this book delves behind the scenes, emphasizing three key areas:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Processes</li>\n<li>Tools</li>\n<li>Culture</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let’s cover each, as I think some parts are more insightful than others.</p>\n<h2>Remember that You Aren’t Google</h2>\n<p>Keep in mind one thing while reading this book: Most companies don’t have the problems, the scale, or the resources that Google has. For most people, many of the solutions presented in this book won’t apply.</p>\n<p>I’ve only realized this after I joined a BigTech company. It’s hard to picture the difference in scale until you see it firsthand. For instance, I find <a href=\"https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/stacked-diffs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">stacked diffs</a> quite useful. However, I think they work in a very specific environment, and I’ve got ex-colleagues who just couldn’t imagine that being useful. And that’s fine.</p>\n<p>Anyways, back to the book.</p>\n<h2>Processes: Making it Work At Scale</h2>\n<p>Google is renowned for its massive mono repo. What you do can affect a lot of other engineers, thus they developed a strong culture around reviews. They have systems around who can review which technology or aspect that’s quite interesting. In a past gig, they copied the system with terrible results. Beware of copying anything if you don’t have the necessary resources.</p>\n<p>Another unique area is testing. At this size, running tests becomes kind of a probabilistic exercise. Any test that can be flaky will become so if it runs millions of times. Google is also famous for having popularized the <a href=\"../book-review-site-reliability-workbook/\">SRE</a> role. However, operations aren’t covered in this book that much.</p>\n<h2>Tools: The Secret Weapon</h2>\n<p>Tooling is my favorite part of this book. Developer tools that seamlessly work are extremely satisfying. Also, this is the last thing a small company should try to copy. Internal tools are challenging to nail, and the incentives skew against them.</p>\n<p>Moreover, it’s an existential thing at a certain scale. A mono repo as gigantic as Google’s needs top-notch tooling. Otherwise, you can’t even browse files properly. The same goes for navigating code. You need a supercharged <code class=\"language-text\">grep</code> that works quickly and reliably across the whole repo.</p>\n<p>I really like the chapter that touches on large-scale changes. A change across hundreds or thousands of files feels magical when it actually works.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, CI/CD is pretty vanilla at Google. Granted, it seamlessly works with much bigger volumes of changes. Other than that, it doesn’t do anything out of the ordinary. Check this <a href=\"../modernizing-your-build-pipelines/\">old article I wrote for comparison</a>.</p>\n<h2>Culture: Have the Right People</h2>\n<p>Culture is the weakest part of the whole book. It left me pretty cold. My theory is that BigTech has such a huge pool of candidates willing to join that it can rely on a pretty decent average for engineers. Some of the agile methodologies seem to make less sense in this context.</p>\n<p>Reading through these chapters didn’t feel too insightful. I’d rather check <a href=\"../book-review-team-topologies/\">Team Topologies</a>, <a href=\"../book-review-accelerate/\">Accelerate</a>, or plenty of other books.</p>\n<h2>Verdict</h2>\n<p>A few years ago, reading about Google practices could feel like science fiction. Nowadays, cloud providers and a host of SaaS tools for observability, feature toggles, and whatnot have made this tooling accessible. It doesn’t feel as foreign as it once did, although we’re still talking about a completely different game in terms of scale.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, it’s an enjoyable read. You get a reasonable idea of how BigTech works internally, in case you <a href=\"../tips-for-coding-interviews-at-faang/\">want to get in</a>. The book gets ⭐⭐⭐⭐ stars from me.</p>","frontmatter":{"layout":"post","title":"Book Review: Software Engineering at Google","path":"/book-review-software-engineering-google/","categories":["Book Review","Software Engineering","Practices","Testing"],"date":"2023/12/10","draft":false,"description":"Software engineering at Google offers an interesting peek at how Google develops software internally","canonical":null,"image":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/f4c6ee677d7af7e12fa92a96fd1ff60c/f7359/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/static/f4c6ee677d7af7e12fa92a96fd1ff60c/ca779/cover.jpg 95w,\n/static/f4c6ee677d7af7e12fa92a96fd1ff60c/eaf1e/cover.jpg 191w,\n/static/f4c6ee677d7af7e12fa92a96fd1ff60c/f7359/cover.jpg 381w","sizes":"(min-width: 381px) 381px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/f4c6ee677d7af7e12fa92a96fd1ff60c/e3f0d/cover.webp 95w,\n/static/f4c6ee677d7af7e12fa92a96fd1ff60c/ac33c/cover.webp 191w,\n/static/f4c6ee677d7af7e12fa92a96fd1ff60c/bcfea/cover.webp 381w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 381px) 381px, 100vw"}]},"width":750,"height":984.251968503937}}}}},"related":{"nodes":[{"frontmatter":{"title":"How Do You Structure an Engineering Team?","path":"/how-do-you-structure-an-engineering-team/","date":"2021/07/31"}},{"frontmatter":{"title":"Tips for Coding Interviews at FAANG","path":"/tips-for-coding-interviews-at-faang/","date":"2022/07/11"}},{"frontmatter":{"title":"Book Review: Site Reliability Workbook","path":"/book-review-site-reliability-workbook/","date":"2022/05/23"}}]},"previous":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Book Review: Effective Remote Work","path":"/book-review-effective-remote-work/","date":"2022/11/27"}},"next":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Book Review: Site Reliability Workbook","path":"/book-review-site-reliability-workbook/","date":"2022/05/23"}}},"pageContext":{"related":["/book-review-site-reliability-workbook/","/tips-for-coding-interviews-at-faang/","/how-do-you-structure-an-engineering-team/"],"previous":"/book-review-effective-remote-work/","next":"/book-review-site-reliability-workbook/"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
