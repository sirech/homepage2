I remember advocating for immutable data and using streams in a project I was on, where we were stuck with <em>Java</em>. Switching to <em>Kotlin</em> was such a breath of fresh air. This is the book that helped me during that period.</p>\n<p>I would say the ideal target audience is folks who are already familiar with <em>Java</em> and want to learn <em>Kotlin</em>. You’ll get started faster, and you’ll be able to appreciate how much more concise and usable <em>Kotlin</em> is. That seems to be a common origin for most people learning <em>Kotlin</em>, but in any case, you should be able to pick it up regardless of your background, as long as you do have some experience programming.</p>\n<h2>Learning Kotlin</h2>\n<p>This book focuses on introducing you to <em>Kotlin</em>, from its syntax to features like nullable types, collections, or operators. The later chapters are dedicated to some more advanced concepts, like reflection or building DSLs. Interestingly, <a href=\"https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines/coroutines-guide.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">coroutines</a> don’t make an appearance.</p>\n<p>As usual with learning a new programming language, a healthy combination of reading and practicing is advisable. Given that there are no exercises to practice in the book, I recommend <a href=\"https://exercism.io/tracks/kotlin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">exercism</a> to get started and the <a href=\"https://github.com/sirech/kotlintapas\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kotlin Tapas</a> I shared some time ago.</p>\n<p>The book doesn’t make assumptions about your target environment. Whether you want to do backend development or mobile, it is the right place to get acquainted with the basic constructs of the language. It is written by two members of the core development team of <em>Kotlin</em>, who are knowledgeable about the language and present it in a clear and approachable way.</p>\n<h2>Next steps</h2>\n<p>As I mentioned, this book functions as an introduction to the language. If you want to explore it further, I liked <a href=\"https://www.manning.com/books/the-joy-of-kotlin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The joy of Kotlin</a>, which is definitely not an introduction book. I’ve heard good things about <a href=\"https://leanpub.com/effectivekotlin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Effective Kotlin</a>, although I haven’t read that one myself.</p>\n<h2>Verdict</h2>\n<p>An excellent way of getting started with <em>Kotlin</em>. It doesn’t go too much into idiomatic <em>Kotlin</em>, however. Nevertheless, it’s worth ⭐⭐⭐⭐ stars for me.</p>","frontmatter":{"layout":"post","title":"Book Review: Kotlin in Action","path":"/book-review-kotlin-in-action/","categories":["Book Review","Kotlin"],"date":"2020/06/28","draft":false,"description":"Kotlin in Action is an excellent resource to get started with Kotlin, a language that is quickly becoming an alternative to Java","canonical":null,"image":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/eb69c5e5c82ef4645b26036684966186/c2172/kotlin-in-action.jpg","srcSet":"/static/eb69c5e5c82ef4645b26036684966186/15a72/kotlin-in-action.jpg 88w,\n/static/eb69c5e5c82ef4645b26036684966186/76821/kotlin-in-action.jpg 175w,\n/static/eb69c5e5c82ef4645b26036684966186/c2172/kotlin-in-action.jpg 350w","sizes":"(min-width: 350px) 350px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/eb69c5e5c82ef4645b26036684966186/a3ef8/kotlin-in-action.webp 88w,\n/static/eb69c5e5c82ef4645b26036684966186/cdaff/kotlin-in-action.webp 175w,\n/static/eb69c5e5c82ef4645b26036684966186/48bea/kotlin-in-action.webp 350w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 350px) 350px, 100vw"}]},"width":750,"height":940.7142857142858}}}}},"related":{"nodes":[]},"previous":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Book Review: Securing DevOps","path":"/book-review-securing-devops/","date":"2020/05/26"}},"next":{"frontmatter":{"title":"A directory structure for React projects","path":"/a-directory-structure-for-react-projects/","date":"2020/07/19"}}},"pageContext":{"related":[],"previous":"/book-review-securing-devops/","next":"/a-directory-structure-for-react-projects/"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
