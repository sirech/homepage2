As you might’ve heard, it’s a relatively low-level systems programming language. Similar to <a href=\"https://golang.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">golang</a> in a sense, with a completely different approach to memory management.</p>\n<p>Apart from the classical use cases, I really like using <em>Rust</em> to make fast, super-portable CLI tools that are easy to package in a container. A compiled binary is a lot easier to handle than something like a <em>Python</em>-based tool with a ton of dependencies.</p>\n<p>For a systems programming language, <em>Rust</em> is surprisingly rich in features. Pattern matching, <code class=\"language-text\">Option</code>, and <code class=\"language-text\">Result</code> types, who knew? This power comes at the cost of complexity. <em>Rust</em> is definitely <strong>not</strong> a simple language, which is why this book clocks at 500 pages. The borrow checker is very different from anything you’ve seen before, and you’ll have to re-read that chapter over and over until you start making sense of the concept. Lifetimes are pretty tricky as well. By the time things like multi-threading came around, I was pretty overwhelmed.</p>\n<p>Luckily, this book is an excellent reference to navigate all these ideas. And it covers the ecosystem as well, which is a nice plus. You’ll learn about <a href=\"https://crates.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cargo</a>, its build system, and package manager. Testing makes an appearance, which is great news for all the TDD lovers.</p>\n<p>All in all, if you want to get started understanding <em>Rust</em>, this book is an excellent starting point. It won’t be the last one you read if you’re going to get a deeper understanding of the whole thing.</p>\n<h2>Verdict</h2>\n<p>This is a comprehensive book, not only introducing the language but the ecosystem as well. The only thing I missed was going a bit more into the community’s best practices and established conventions. Although to be fair, it’s already a pretty long book as it’s. It gets ⭐⭐⭐⭐ stars from me.</p>","frontmatter":{"layout":"post","title":"Book Review: The Rust programming language","path":"/book-review-the-rust-programming-language/","categories":["Book Review","Rust","Systems Programming"],"date":"2020/09/20","draft":false,"description":"Rust is a trendy pick for a programming language these days.
