I’ve been using it at work for the past year, and I always felt that I could barely understand what was going on. Picking up this book is a great way to start filling those gaps. Roughly, there are the following sections:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Application Monitoring</li>\n<li>Infrastructure Monitoring</li>\n<li>PromQL</li>\n<li>Alerting</li>\n<li>Deployment</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Whether you are monitoring applications or infrastructure, the core components are the same. Instrumenting the code or using exporters, and then publishing metrics that Prometheus will scrape, with a few labels to sprinkle on top.</p>\n<p>There are plenty of components that need to be deployed to have a more complete setup. The <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">node-exporter</a>, the <a href=\"https://github.com/prometheus/blackbox_exporter\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">blackbox-exporter</a>, and others make an appearance. This is more relevant as an operator, however.</p>\n<p>I set up a simple installation of Prometheus to try things more practically. It’s in <a href=\"https://github.com/sirech/example-prometheus-setup\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this repository</a> and can be run with Docker.</p>\n<h2>PromQL</h2>\n<p>The toughest part of the book is the comprehensive overview of <em>PromQL</em>, Prometheus’s query language. If you want to write queries that make any sense, this section is a must-read. Otherwise, you’ll find yourself trying different combinations of <code class=\"language-text\">sum</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">rate</code>, and whatnot until your queries somehow work.</p>\n<h2>Alerting</h2>\n<p>Alerting is especially relevant if you handle on-call for a system. From experience, a misconfigured alerting setup can cause a lot of friction and pain, so it’s good to invest in understanding which kind of alerts you can get, and when.</p>\n<h2>Dashboarding</h2>\n<p>Visualizing your metrics is a big part of monitoring, which in this ecosystem is handled by <a href=\"https://grafana.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">grafana</a>. Grafana is another complex beast. You’ll find about twenty pages on the topic, which is not nearly enough to get a deep understanding of how to build all those fancy dashboards that you see out there. But it’s an interesting appetizer to get started.</p>\n<h2>Verdict</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thoughtworks.com/de/radar/tools/prometheus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Prometheus</a> has been around for a while, all in all. It seems to be the standard monitoring collecting tool these days. Knowing about it is a good investment of your time, and I think this book strikes a reasonable balance of being practical and giving you deeper insights, thus getting ⭐⭐⭐⭐ stars.</p>","frontmatter":{"layout":"post","title":"Book Review: Prometheus up and running","path":"/book-review-prometheus-up-and-running/","categories":["Book Review","Monitoring","DevOps","Prometheus"],"date":"2021/01/08","draft":false,"description":"Get started with Prometheus thanks to this book, which is both practical and comprehensive","canonical":null,"image":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/ee722eca2516bc39c2cd0f475c9fc8bc/59111/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/static/ee722eca2516bc39c2cd0f475c9fc8bc/b475b/cover.jpg 50w,\n/static/ee722eca2516bc39c2cd0f475c9fc8bc/b01d5/cover.jpg 100w,\n/static/ee722eca2516bc39c2cd0f475c9fc8bc/59111/cover.jpg 200w","sizes":"(min-width: 200px) 200px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/ee722eca2516bc39c2cd0f475c9fc8bc/f4c93/cover.webp 50w,\n/static/ee722eca2516bc39c2cd0f475c9fc8bc/bc7a4/cover.webp 100w,\n/static/ee722eca2516bc39c2cd0f475c9fc8bc/975f1/cover.webp 200w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 200px) 200px, 100vw"}]},"width":750,"height":982.4999999999999}}}}},"related":{"nodes":[{"frontmatter":{"title":"Book Review: Securing DevOps","path":"/book-review-securing-devops/","date":"2020/05/26"}},{"frontmatter":{"title":"Setting up OAuth for Grafana with Auth0","path":"/setting-up-oauth-for-grafana-with-auth0/","date":"2021/01/17"}}]},"previous":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Provisioning an Application Load Balancer with Terraform","path":"/provisioning-an-application-load-balancer-with-terraform/","date":"2021/01/02"}},"next":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Book Review: No rules rules, Netflix and the culture of reinvention","path":"/book-review-no-rules-rules-netflix/","date":"2020/12/13"}}},"pageContext":{"related":["/book-review-securing-devops/","/setting-up-oauth-for-grafana-with-auth0/"],"previous":"/provisioning-an-application-load-balancer-with-terraform/","next":"/book-review-no-rules-rules-netflix/"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
